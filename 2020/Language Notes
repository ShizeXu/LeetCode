1. Bit right shift (left is always logical):
    a. c++:
            i: signed int: logical 
            ii: unsigned int: arithmetic
    b. Jave:
            i: >>: arithmetic
            ii: >>>: logical
2. Unicode vs UTF-8
    a. Unicode: a big dict of all chars from different languages
    b. UTF-8: a variable-width character encoding capable of encoding all 1,112,064 valid character code points in Unicode using 1-4 byte code units
