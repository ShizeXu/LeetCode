1. Bit right shift (left is always logical):
    a. c++:
            i: signed int: logical (0 regardless of sign)
            ii: unsigned int: arithmetic
    b. Jave:
            i: >>: arithmetic
            ii: >>>: logical

2. Unicode vs UTF-8
    a. Unicode: a big dict of all chars from different languages
    b. UTF-8: a variable-width character encoding capable of encoding all 1,112,064 valid character code points in Unicode using 1-4 byte code units

3. Priority Queue
    a. Compare function is reversed (min-heap: greater<int>; max-heap: less<int>)
    b. Customized compare function usage (lambda):
        auto mycomp = [](a, b){ // };
        priority_queue<T, vector<T>, decltype(mycomp)> pq(mycomp);

4. Unordered_*
    a. Map or set doesn't take pair/vector or other class as key due to missing built in hash function
    b. Customized hash function:
        struct pair_hash
        {
                template <class T1, class T2>
                std::size_t operator() (const std::pair<T1, T2> &pair) const
                {
                        return std::hash<T1>()(pair.first) ^ std::hash<T2>()(pair.second);
                }
        };

5. Arithmatic operators
    include<cmath>
    a. a ^ b: pow(a, b)
    b. log_a(b): log_10(b) / log_10(a)
        log(x): log_e(x)
        log2(x), log10(x)
    c. a ^ 1/2: sqrt(a)

6. Random number
    a. rand() % mod
    b. srand(time(0)) would be predictable even if waits

7. Concurrency
    a. this_thread::sleep_for(chrono::milliseconds(x)), this_thread::yield()
    b. mutex: mutex a; a.lock(); a.unlock();
    c. conditional_variable:
        mutex mtx;
        condition_variable cv;
        T1:
            unique_lock<mutex> lck(mtx);
            while (!ready) cv.wait(lck);
            ...
        T2:
            ready = true;
            cv.notify_all();
    d. new thread:
        thread t1(void_function, param1, ...);
	    thread t2(void_function, param1, ...);
	    t1.join();
	    t2.join();
    e. RWLock:
        C++11: read: shared_lock; write: unique_lock; Best practice: release read lock before upgrade to write lock
    f. ThreadPool:
        

8. Foo::Bar(int random_arg) == int Foo_Bar(Foo* this, int random_arg)

9. Semaphore vs. Mutex
    a. signalling vs locking mechanisms
    b. A mutex can only be released by the thread which has ownership, i.e. the thread which previously called the Wait function, (or which took ownership when creating it). A semaphore can be released by any thread
    c. Semaphore can have resource count being more than 1
    c. A thread can call a wait function repeatedly on a recursive mutex without blocking. Semaphore would also cause block when same thread waits on the same semaphore multiple times
