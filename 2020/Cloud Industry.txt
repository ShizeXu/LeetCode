Redis & Memcached:
    1. Both Redis and MemCached are in-memory, open-source data stores. Memcached, a high-performance distributed memory cache service, is designed for simplicity while Redis offers a rich set of features that make it effective for a wide range of use cases.
    2. Faster (μs), in contrast to databases that store data on disk or SSDs (ms).

No-SQL:
    1. Key-Value
        E.g. Redis, Memcached, Voldemort, DynamoDB, LevelDB, RocksDB, Bigtable
    2. Document DB
        E.g. CouchDB, MongoDB
    3. Wide-Column DB (two-dimensional key–value store)
        E.g. Cassandra (Cell based storage), HBase (Column based storage)
    4. Graph DB
        E.g. Neo4J, InfiniteGraph

Efficiency:
    1. MySQL / PostgreSQL : 1k QPS
    2. Cassandra / MongoDB : 10k QPS
    3. Redis / Memcached : 100k - 1m QPS 
    4. Machine: Laptop 100; single workstation: <=1k; ...

REST vs. SOAP:
    1. More flexible and simpler request format: jsut a simple URL (using HTTP verbs like Get/Put/Post/Delete/etc.), avoid the rquirement of XML request format
    2. Response is flexible instead of XML/HTML:  Command Separated Value (CSV), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and Really Simple Syndication (RSS)

Communication between Microservices:
    1. System (with request instruction)
        REST over HTTP protocol (synchronous), gRPC (google Remote Procedure Call), SMTP (mail), FTP (file)
            a. OSS: AMQP (asynchronous), STOMP, and JMS
    2. Data stream
        TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
    3. SQL Server sets up TCP session
        Client API (ODBC/JDBC/SqlClient) -> Gateway -> TCP Socket duplication -> TCP session with SQL Server

Client sets up connection with server:
    1. HTTP Long Polling
        Client sends a request with timeout, and servers responses or waits until has something to response.
    2. WebSocket
        Maintain TCP Connection. Server can push message back.

Rate Limiter:
    The token bucket allows for sudden increase in traffic to some extent, while the leaky bucket is mainly used to ensure the smooth outflow rate.
    1. Token bucket (burstable, limit the average rate)
    2. Leaky bucket (smooth, limit the processing rate)
        The implementation of the leaky bucket algorithm usually relies on the queue.
        If your system receives a new access request and the queue is not full, it puts the request into the queue.
        A processor pulls requests from the queue and processes it at a fixed frequency.
        If the volume of the inbound access requests is too large and the queue becomes full, new requests will be discarded.

Bloomer filter (in Bigtable) vs. Hashtable:
    Much more space efficient with tradeoff of some false positives

HTTP Error Codes:
    1. Informational responses (100–199)
        100: Continue
        101: Switching Protocol (protocol upgrade)
    2. Successful responses (200–299)
        200: Okay
        201: Created
        202: Accepted
        203: Non-Authoritative Information
        204: No Content
        205: Reset Content
        206: Partial Content
    3. Redirects (300–399)
    4. Client errors (400–499)
        400: Bad Request
        401: Client Not Authorized
        402: Payment Required
        403: Forbidden (client identity is known to server)
        404: Not Found
        405: Method Not Allowed
        408: Request Timeout
        429: Too many requests
    5. Server errors (500–599)
        500: Internal Server Error
        501: Not Implemented
        502: Bad Gateway
        503: Service Unavailable
        504: Gateway Timeout
        505: HTTP Version Not Supported

JSON: JSON objects are written in key/value pairs. Keys must be strings, and values must be a valid JSON data type (string, number, object, array, boolean or null).
