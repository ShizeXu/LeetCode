Redis & Memcached:
    1. Both Redis and MemCached are in-memory, open-source data stores. Memcached, a high-performance distributed memory cache service, is designed for simplicity while Redis offers a rich set of features that make it effective for a wide range of use cases.
    2. Faster (μs), in contrast to databases that store data on disk or SSDs (ms).

No-SQL:
    1. Key-Value
        E.g. Redis, Memcached, Voldemort, DynamoDB, LevelDB, RocksDB
    2. Document DB
        E.g. CouchDB, MongoDB
    3. Wide-Column DB ()
        E.g. Cassandra (Cell based storage), HBase (Column based storage)
    4. Graph DB
        E.g. Neo4J, InfiniteGraph

Effeciency:
    1. MySQL / PostgreSQL : 1k QPS
    2. Cassandra / MongoDB : 10k QPS
    3. Redis / Memcached : 100k - 1m QPS
    4. Machine: Laptop 100; single workstation: <=1k; ...


Communication between Microservices:
    1. System (with request instruction)
        REST HTTP (synchronous), gRPC (google Remote Procedure Call), SMTP (mail), FTP (file)
            a. OSS: AMQP (asynchronous), STOMP, and JMS
    2. Data stream
        TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
    3. SQL Server sets up TCP session
        Client API (ODBC/JDBC/SqlClient) -> Gateway -> TCP Socket duplication -> SQL Server

Client sets up connection with server:
    1. HTTP Long Polling
        Client sends a request with timeout, and servers responses or waits until has something to response.
    2. WebSocket
        Maintain TCP Connection. Server can push message back.

Rate Limiter:
    The token bucket allows for sudden increase in traffic to some extent, while the leaky bucket is mainly used to ensure the smooth outflow rate.
    1. Token bucket (burstable, limit the average rate)
    2. Leaky bucket (smooth, limit the processing rate)
        The implementation of the leaky bucket algorithm usually relies on the queue.
        If your system receives a new access request and the queue is not full, it puts the request into the queue.
        A processor pulls requests from the queue and processes it at a fixed frequency.
        If the volume of the inbound access requests is too large and the queue becomes full, new requests will be discarded.
