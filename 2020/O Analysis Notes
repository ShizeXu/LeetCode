1. There are two key attributes that a problem must have in order for dynamic programming to be applicable: optimal substructure and overlapping sub-problems. 
   If a problem can be solved by combining optimal solutions to non-overlapping sub-problems, the strategy is called "divide and conquer" instead.

2. Build Max/Min heap
    a. Bottom-up, O(N)
    b. Top-down, O(NlogN)
